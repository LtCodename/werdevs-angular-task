    <p>Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
        proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank
        you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be
        involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just
        didn’t hold with such nonsense.
    </p>
    <p> Mr Dursley was the director of a fi rm called Grunnings,
        which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly
        any neck, although he did have a very large moustache.
        Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
        usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent
        so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
        neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and
        in their opinion there was no fi ner boy anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>  The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also
        had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would
        discover it. They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone
        found out about the Potters.
